-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

select b.break_id, c.cocoa_name,l.location_name
from cocoa_logs cl join cocoa_types c
on cl.cocoa_id=c.cocoa_id
join break_schedule b 
on cl.break_id=b.break_id
join locations l
on b.location_id=l.location_id
